# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN
 This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for cancer diagnosis using a feature dataset. It involves data preparation, normalization, and reshaping for 3D input. A CNN model with convolutional and dense layers is trained, and predictions are evaluated for accuracy. Gradio is used to create an interface for user input and diagnosis.
